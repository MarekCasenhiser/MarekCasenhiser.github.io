        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

        <h3>worldworstwebsite</h3>
        <a href="https://worldworstwebsite.com/">worldworstwebsite</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: The coloring here has no distinct theme. The color scheme is bright and assults the eyes so much it leaves the viewer disoriented.</li>
            <li>Repitition: There is little to no repitition here, the fonts are all different, the colors are constantly changing, and the links are largely inconsistant.</li>
            <li>Alignment: There are literally no visual connections to where I am supposed to go. There are only links scattered around the page in a disoragnized manner.</li>
            <li>Proximity: The navigation is incredibly disoragnized. Some links lead nowhere, others are found at the bottom of the page. And there is a search bar, but you need to access an unkown area in the website.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Canvas</h3>
        <a href="https://instructure.charlotte.edu/calendar#view_name=month&view_start=2026-01-29">Canvas</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Here the coloring is relatively uniform. It takes advantage of shading so that it may by aesthetically pleasing for the viewer whilst also staying readible.</li>
            <li>Repitition: The majority of fonts stay uniform with little changes. All of the visuals are created in such a way where they complement the text rather than conflict with it.</li>
            <li>Alignment: The visual connections make sense and allow the viewer to more easilly navigate the page.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Everything is close to where it needs to be and is easilly accessable by the viewer.</li>
        </ul>
