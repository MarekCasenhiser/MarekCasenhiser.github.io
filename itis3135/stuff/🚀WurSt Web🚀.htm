    <img src="Pictures/Itsinhere/keepgoing/AlmostThere/image" width="700" height="400" alt="This “operating” system is the biggest piece of shit I've ever come across in my fucking life. It can't even be classified as an operating system. Windows 11 is a fucking website made with React by the antichrist himself, whose sole purpose is to consume 2 TB of RAM just by opening Notepad, how could you screw up so badly as to ruin Notepad, to ruin Paint, how the hell did Micropenis manage to add a battle pass to Solitaire, you motherfucking pieces of shit? How can a rational, moral human being with brain cells defend this mutant technological abortion, 30% programmed with AI? my ass, not even an AI agent would be capable of screwing up so badly as to create this android ripoff. This is the result of a bunch of bad decisions made by people whose brains, unfortunately, were unable to develop fully, whose balls got stuck in their abdomen during birth and who don't shit themselves by some miracle of God. I bet my vital organs that these morons aren't aware of how shitty this operating system is because everyone at Microsoft uses MacOS. I thought operating systems were programmed by programmers, not the fucking marketing department. To those subnormals, I propose a brilliant marketing campaign: rename this mistake to Windows 9/11, this fucking shitty operating system forces me to use L*nux (Mint, because i'm not a pedo), at least with that I don't have to drop everything I'm doing and restart the computer for every fucking update, how the hell do you manage to release an update every fucking day? What's being updated, your chromosomes?. One day I'm going to really lose it, and when that day comes, I'll create a Microsoft account and I swear to God that every time I take a shit, I'll take a picture of it and upload it to my OneDrive just to fill my OneDrive with high-quality photos of my feces. This OS made me an atheist, because I refuse to believe that hell exists, I refuse to believe that there is anything worse than having to use Windows 11.">
